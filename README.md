Project Overview

Vapor Platform is a distributed client–server system developed in three incremental stages to explore core concepts of network programming and distributed architectures. The project evolves from a low-level socket-based implementation to an asynchronous model and finally to a fully distributed solution using modern communication technologies.

Across its stages, the system incorporates concurrency and synchronization, asynchronous programming with async/await, and inter-service communication using gRPC, RabbitMQ, and REST APIs. The final architecture includes multiple independent services (client, main server, statistics server, and administrative server), supports remote management, event-driven processing, and is fully containerized using Docker.

This project emphasizes scalability, maintainability, and clear architectural decisions, demonstrating a progressive approach to building robust distributed systems.
